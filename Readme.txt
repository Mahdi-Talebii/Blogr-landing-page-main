hello guys
this is another challenge from website front-end mentor.
I've tried my best to make it look like the original design,
just a little problem,
since I haven't learn Js yet, I couldn't do the mobile menu correctly.
I wanted to do it fully with html and css but, it seemed a little impractical.
hope you enjoy:)
